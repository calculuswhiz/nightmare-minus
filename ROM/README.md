## Archer Emblem ROM Notes:
### Warnings
- You *must* beat the game once before loading, otherwise, you will get stuck in the tutorial, and that's no fun.
  - In order to play, rename your copy of `FE7 Archer Mod~.gba` to whatever your ROM was called.
- Some characters do not have battle animations as archers or snipers. E.g. Lucius, Hawkeye, Nino (as a sniper)
  - This will glitch out Arena fights. The fight will not finish and you will waste a turn.
  - This will crash the game when fighting the dragon. If a character does not have a battle animation, do not use them as the dragonslayer.
- Backup your save files!
### Changes (the ones I remembered to document)
- All characters start out as Archer/Sniper except ninian/nils.
- Fiora spawns in a couple blocks south to prevent a crash.
- Farina spawns in a couple blocks west to allow traversal of terrain.
- Legault's AI had been changed to not run away.
- All promotion items can now promote archers.
- All archers/snipers can steal and pick locks (with lockpick item) in addition to riding the ballista.
- Usual Conversions (There may be exceptions):
    - Bow skill = max base skill of original character
    - Rapier/Armads/Mani Katti have been changed into bows with the same stats. No longer locked to lords.
    - Iron bow <- Iron weapon/javelin/hand axe/fire/heal staff 
    - Steel bow <- Steel weapon/spear/thunder/elfire/recover staff
    - Silver bow <- silver weapon/physic staff
    - Short bow <- slim weapon
    - Killer bow <- killer weapon
    - Brave bow <- brave weapon/Fortify
    - Rienfleche <- Legendary weapons. For some reason, I can't find the Sol Katti's address anywhere, so...
- Sol Katti has undergone some changes (just there to unstuck your run in case you forgot supports and/or Fila's Might):
	- It's a bow of course
	- Brave effect
	- Luna effect
	- Not locked to Lyn
  - 1 use.
- Fog of war has been mostly removed because it's stupid. (Unfortunately don't know how to get around ch 9's fog as it is event driven.)
- Bandit's AI changed in chapter 3 to not loot village. Otherwise, you won't have a chance of making it.
### Advice
- If you don't want to cheese the last boss with the new "Sol Katti," please do get Fila's Might from the desert and/or farm supports. Keep in mind different supports help in different ways.
  - Your rank is already screwed up anyway, so don't bother with this ROM.
- Keep someone in mind for your dragonslayer. General guidelines:
  - Must have battle animation (see warnings)!
  - Fast enough to double.
  - Strong enough to deal damage with a Rienfleche on the fire dragon.
    - The absolute minimum attack you need is 21 to do 1 damage without bonuses. Again, supports and Fila's Might is strongly recommended.
  - Enough HP to take a 34-damage blast.
- Stock up on healing items when you can. They are the only way you can heal and stay on the move. You will need elixirs for the final map.
- This ROM is very unfair in the early game (but beatable). Save states/RNG manipulation are welcome.
